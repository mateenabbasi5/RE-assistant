  "user_story": "A requirements analyst uses an AI tool that highlights unclear requirement statements and suggests better wording. The analyst reviews each suggestion, chooses which ones to accept, edits a few, and rejects the rest. The final requirements are shaped by both the analyst\u2019s expertise and the AI system\u2019s support. This is a clear case of Human\u2013AI collaboration.",
  "generated_ac": "1. The system shall identify and highlight unclear requirement statements based on predefined criteria for clarity and specificity.\n\n2. The system shall provide at least three suggested rewordings for each highlighted unclear requirement statement to assist the analyst.\n\n3. The system shall allow the analyst to accept, edit, or reject each suggested rewording, maintaining a record of the analyst's decisions.\n\n4. The system shall enable the analyst to compile and finalize the revised requirements based on the accepted suggestions and edits, generating a coherent document.",
