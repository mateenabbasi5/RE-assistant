  "user_story": "A requirements analyst uses an AI tool that highlights unclear requirement statements and suggests better wording. The analyst reviews each suggestion, chooses which ones to accept, edits a few, and rejects the rest. The final requirements are shaped by both the analyst\u2019s expertise and the AI system\u2019s support. This is a clear case of Human\u2013AI collaboration.",
